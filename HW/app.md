## InstaTasty

InstaTasty is an app that plays "Tasty" videos and instantly makes the dish for you. You connect this app to a machine that produces all types of food.


When the application opens it will show a feed of "Popular Tasty Videos", and on the left hand side there will be a menu.

The menu options are:
Appetizer
Main Course
Dessert

Each page will show Tasty videos for that category. After watching a video, you will have the option to press "Make it", or the option to go back to the feed of videos.

When clicking "Make it", if the app is connected to the food producing machine, it will instantly make that dish for you.
