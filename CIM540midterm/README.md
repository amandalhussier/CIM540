Title: Donation Page for the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment

I am making this project for my STC436 Public Relations Campaign class. This is the capstone course for all public relations majors, where we are assigned a real-life client to do public relations services for. The Ron Magill Conservation Endowment needs both a website and a donation page for that website. I will be working on the website on my own time, but the midterm for this class would be making a donation page because that could use interactive coding.

Inputs and Outputs:
I have two buttons. One leads to a link where you can donate to the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment. The other leads to a web page that teaches you more about the Endowment.
I also have three pictures that give explanations of how the money is being used when you mouse hovers over it. These pictures are places on the map to represent where the cause is located.


Target audience:
Target audience: potential donors to the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment
This project will be displayed on the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment website that will soon be created.
